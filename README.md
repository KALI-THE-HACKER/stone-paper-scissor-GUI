## Stone Paper Scissor Game [GUI version, Python3]

This a graphical version of the stone-paper-scissors game. The program / script is written in Python3 programming language aided with the support of tkinter library (for serving the GUI widgets and other items). The game has the same old school rules of the stone-paper-scissor game. The game is also known as __Rock-Paper-Scissor__ game sometimes. The script file has the dependencies of the tkinter library. The tkinter library is generally available by default on windows computer systems, but in linux computer system we have to install these dependencies. Below section of the dependencies also explains the way to install it.
