"""
Stone-Paper-Scissor Game [GUI, Python3]

This is a stone-paper-scissors game supplied with graphical user interface. The script is written in Python3 programming language, and tkinter library is also used in this project in order to supply proper GUI widgets. The game uses the same old school rules of the Stone-Paper-Scissors game (Rock-Paper-Scissors game).
Dependencies :
1. tkinter - An external python3 library for supplying proper GUI widgets. This module is present in windows by default, and for the linux operating systems, we need to install it externally.

Changes made in last modification :
1. Added the older source code into this main.py file and replaces some of the variables, as well as changes the entire code structure.
2. Removed all older methods of the calculation and displaying of the score to a new way, where we removed all the previously defined functions with 2 single functions - checkResults, and main. Also, we changed the way to display the result of the current round, from changing the tkinter window to just displaying a message box.
3. Added commented docs + added comment lines within lines of codes.

Stone --> 1
Paper --> 2
Scissors --> 3
These conventions are to be used during the calculation of the result of each rounds of the game, even the user enters the input through the radiobuttons, and these 1,2,3 are the values that are recieved.
The calculations of the result also uses some conventions for the score increment and decrement, which are listed below :
1. Win --> +5 score
2. Draw --> +0 score
3. Loss --> -10 score
And, the win, loss, and draw are generated using the rules of the old school game of stone-paper-scissors. """
